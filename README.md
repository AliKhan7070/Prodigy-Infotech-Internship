## Temperature Converter

This program converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. It prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. The program then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the converted values to the user.

### Example:
If the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program will convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin and display the results.

### How to Run:
1. Run the script.
2. Input a temperature value and select the unit of measurement.
3. View the converted temperatures in Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

## Guess the Number Game

This program generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program prompts the user to input their guess, compares it to the generated number, and provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the number correctly, and the number of attempts taken is displayed.

### How to Run:
1. Run the script.
2. Guess the randomly generated number.
3. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you get it right, and the number of attempts will be shown at the end.

## Sudoku Solver

This program solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. It takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and uses an algorithm (backtracking or other techniques) to fill in the missing numbers. The program explores possible solutions and finds the correct arrangement of numbers for the puzzle. Once solved, the completed Sudoku grid is displayed.

### How to Run:
1. Provide the unsolved Sudoku grid as input (can be hardcoded or provided by the user).
2. The program will solve the puzzle and print the completed grid.
